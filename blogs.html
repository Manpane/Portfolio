                        <h3>Why British Education?</h3>
                        UK is among the top developed countries and dream country for many international students. 
                        Education in UK is among the best education system in the world. 
                        British Universities and Colleges focus more on the practical learning rather 
                        than straight forward teaching.

                        Education in Herald College has started to feel not so great nowadays. This is my third weekly blog as an assignment. 
                        And, I am going to express my thoughts and experience on my third week at Herald College Kathmandu(HCK) in this blog.

                        Studying Computer Science is regarded as difficult. When people see long lines of colorful code in the screen,
                        it feels like a really complex work to do. And to study and understand those things seems overwhelming.
                        Obviously it is not like that and to follow up with the course, there must be some proper pattern or learning method. 
                        Herald College has a LTW structure of learning as discussed in previous blog which is quite effective.

                        My learning experience at Herald College Kathmandu for the fifth week is similar to previous weeks.
                        In my previous blog, I had pointed out some of my suggestions on how the
                        LTW structure of the college could be more effective.
                        I think some part of the suggestion has been implemented and some still not.
                        I also believe, it might not be possible to implement all my suggestions. So this is my

                        Herald College Kathmandu (HCK) was in my top colleges list before I had decided the institution
                        that I was gonna get in for my bachelors. HCK is turning out to be my correct decision.
                        In Herald College, I have been learning and implementing powerful skills not just about IT but other also.
                        This blog is more about my academic skills rather than other IT related skills.
                        The major academic skills that I have learnt here are
